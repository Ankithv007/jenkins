# Project Overview

This project utilizes several tools and technologies for effective monitoring, observability, and deployment. Below are the current versions of the key components:

## Tool Versions

- **Terraform**: 1.6.x
- **Docker**: 24.0.x
- **Jenkins**: 2.387.2 (LTS)
- **Kubernetes**: 1.28.x
- **Grafana**: 10.2.x
- **Kibana**: 8.10.x
- **Prometheus**: 2.49.0
- **Jaeger**: 1.45.0
- **Ansible**: 2.15.x

## Versioning Explanation

The versioning scheme used for these tools follows the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) convention, which is structured as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- **MAJOR**: This number indicates significant changes that may introduce backward-incompatible features. For example, a change from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x` suggests that there are breaking changes that might affect compatibility.

- **MINOR**: This number represents the addition of new features in a backward-compatible manner. For instance, moving from `1.5.x` to `1.6.x` indicates new features have been added without breaking existing functionality.

- **PATCH**: The last number indicates backward-compatible bug fixes. A change from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1` means that fixes have been made without introducing new features or breaking changes.

### Example Version Structure

- **1.6.x**: This indicates that the software is on the `1.x` line, with `6` as the current MINOR version. The `x` means there may be multiple PATCH releases available (e.g., `1.6.1`, `1.6.2`, etc.), focusing solely on bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Description

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for developing and deploying applications.
- **Jenkins**: Automation server for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.
- **Grafana**: Open-source analytics and monitoring platform for visualizing metrics.
- **Kibana**: Data visualization and exploration tool for Elasticsearch.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring system and time series database.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices.
- **Ansible**: Automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
